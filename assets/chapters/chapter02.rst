Matter's electric properties
********************************

Fundaments
-----------

To understand the basic principles which electricity relies on, we must have in mind specific concepts that we'll develop next: 

**Matter** is everything which has mass and has a place in space. Furthermore, it's made from particles called atoms.

According to studies made at the beginning of the 20th century, it's been observed that the atom itself is also made up from subatomic particles:

    * **Electrons**, they posess negative electric charge (-) and they move arround the atom nucleus in eliptical orbits.
    * **Protons**, these are found in the atom's nucleus and they posses a possitive electric charge (+).
    * **Neutrons**, these are also found in the atom's nucle, and as their name shows, they have a neutral electric charge.

In their natural state, an atom posesses the same number of protons and electrons, obtaining a "neutral" atom. But if they were to have more protons than electrons they'd be named *Positive ion*, in contrary it'd be *Negative ion*.

Understanding these basic concepts, we can begin to comprenhend the matter electric properties:

Let's imagine for a moment that we have an atom in a **metallic conductor** state, lets supose that this atom **A** has an electron which has been moved to the external atom orbital, the attraction produced from the protons 
to this electron is reduced, and if we were to give more energy to it, this electron contained in the orbital or external cape (also called valence electron) would abandon this atom, which would then be called free electron. 
This “free” electron, is then acquired by another atom (lets supose **B**), which has previously lost an electron. The repetition of this process is called “Ionization”.

This movement is the cause of the **electric current**.
