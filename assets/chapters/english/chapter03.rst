Introduction to the Electrical Phenomena
**********************************

We're all familiar with electricity in one way or another.

We use it everyday to power our tools, from grooming products to the more complicated tools. We need electricity to a point of not being able to conceive of a life without it. And if, for any reason, we don't hav it, we still try to flick on the lights or turn the TV.

**But do we really know what is this force that doesn't occupy space and can even be dangerous?**

When we sit and deeply ponder this question, we rarely arrive to a good conclusion.

Without a doubt, we can say that electricity is a physical phenomenon originated by static or moving electrical charges y their interactions. This tells us that some kind of physical "entity" extists, we'll call it *electrical charge* for now, that can be static or move through the space that surrounds us and interacts with other electrical charges, producing this way the forces we percieve.

Okay then, we know that all **matter** that surrounds is formed in one way or another of "little particles" that together form the world we know. But... How is this particles interact between themselves to join or separate?

This is when electricity enters.

First, we'll start by defining what are this "little particles" that form matter.

Atoms
------

We call atoms to the smallest unit of a chemical element that mantains its identity or properties, and cannot be divided by quemical processes.

The concept of the atom as a basic and indivisible component that makes up the matter of our universe was already postulated by the atomist school in **Ancient Greece**. However, it's existence wasn't proved until the 19th century. With the advances in **Nuclear Physics** in the 20th century it was even proven that the atoms could be subdivided into smaller particles.

**But why do electrons keep "orbiting* around the nucleus and don't break out free?**

It was C.F. Du Fay who demonstrated the existance of "two types of electrivity", one called **positive** and the other **negative**.

The fact is that two objects with positive and negative charge atract each other. On the other hand, if they both are charged with the same type (or sign) of electricity they repel each other.

Today we can say that the protons in the nucleus have positive charge, while the electrons have negative charge. The neutrons are precisely neutral, that is to say, they're not affected by electrical phenomena.

This is why atoms can interact with other atoms, joining y splitting, forming new **substances**, and compose this way the world  that surounds us.
