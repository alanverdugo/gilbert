Antiquity
----------

Around the year *600 BC*, the Greek philosopher **Thales of Miletus** observed that rubbing an amber rod with a skin or wool could attract small bodies. He had also observed that if he rubbed them too long they could cause a spark to jump.

Near Miletus (what is now Turkey), there is an archaeological site called **Magnesia**, where pieces of magnetite were found in ancient times. The **ancient Greeks** observed that pieces of this material were attracted to each other and to small iron objects. The word *magneto* (in English, magnet) comes from the place where it was discovered.

The *Baghdad Battery*, an object found in Iraq in 1938 dated around *250 BC*, resembles an **electrochemical cell**. No documents have been found evidencing its use, although there are other anachronistic descriptions of electrical devices on Egyptian walls and ancient writings.


Modern Age
------------

In 1600, the English scientist **William Gilbert** published his book *De Magnete*, where he uses the Latin word *«electricus»*, derived from the Greek *elektron* - which means amber -, to describe the phenomena discovered by the Greeks. He also established the differences between **magnetism** and **electricity**.

**Otto von Guericke**, who invented an **electrostatic generator**, continued this research continued in 1660. 

**Robert Boyle** stated in 1675 that attraction and repulsion can occur in a vacuum. 

**Stephen Gray** classified in 1729 materials as conductors and insulators. 

**C.F. Du Fay** was the first to identify the two types of electrical charge that would later be called positive and negative. 

**Pieter van Musschenbroek** invented the *Leyden bottle* in 1745, a type of capacitor used for storing electrical charges in large quantities. 

**William Watson** experimented with the *Leyden bottle*, discovering in 1747 that a discharge of static electricity is equivalent to an electric current.

**Benjamin Franklin**, one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, in 1752 he experimented with electricity by flying a kite during a storm. He proved that lightning is produced due to electricity. As a consequence of these experiments, he invented the **lightning rod** and formulated a theory about a fluid that would explain the presence of positive and negative charges.

**Charles-Augustin de Coulomb** in 1777 invented a torsion balance to measure the force of repulsion and electrical attraction. By this procedure, he formulated the principle of interaction of electric charges (Coulomb's law).

Contemporary age
------------------

**Hans Christian Oersted** in 1819 observed that a magnetized needle was oriented by placing itself perpendicular to a conductor to which an electric current was passed. 
**Michael Faraday** in 1831, following this research, discovered that an electric current was generated in a conductor that was exposed to a variable magnetic field.

**Luigi Galvani** in 1790 accidentally discovered that contractions occur in the muscles of a frog in contact with electrically charged metals. 

**Alessandro Volta** discovered that chemical reactions could generate positive charges (cations) and negative charges (anions). When a conductor joins these charges, the difference in electrical potential (also known as voltage) drives an electrical current through the conductor. The potential difference between two points is measured in units of *Volts*, in recognition of *Volta's* work. 

**Humphry Davy** in 1807 worked with electrolysis and thus isolated the alkali metals.

**Thomas Seebeck**, German physicist, in 1821 discovered that an electric current was produced by the application of heat to the union of two different metals. 

**Jean Peltier** in 1834 observed the opposite phenomenon, the absorption of heat through the passage of current in a union of materials. 

**Georg Simon Ohm** in 1827 unraveled a relationship (Ohm's Law) that links the voltage between two points in a circuit and the intensity of current that passes through it, defining the electrical resistance. 

**Gustav Kirchoff**, German physicist, laid out two rules, called Kirchoff's Laws, regarding the distribution of electric current in a shunted electrical circuit.

**James Prescott Joule** in 1841 developed a law that establishes the amount of heat produced in a conductor by the passage of an electric current. 

**Wheatstone** in 1844 devised his bridge to measure electrical resistances.

**Thomas Alva Edison** in 1878 built the first incandescent lamp with carbonized bamboo filaments. 

**Peter Hewitt** in 1901 invented the mercury vapor lamp.

**James Clerk Maxwell**, British physicist, in 1873 published his work *Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism*, where, for the first time, he combines the description of the nature of electromagnetic fields in four equations. 

**Heinrich Hertz** extended this theory and showed that electricity can be transmitted in the form of electromagnetic waves, like light. This research allowed the invention of the *wireless telegraph* and the *radio* to take place.

**Nikola Tesla** experimented with high voltage and polyphase alternating current, thus inventing the **alternator** and the first induction motor in 1882.

**Williams Crookes** invented the *cathode ray tube* in 1872, thanks to the work of **Johann Wilhelm Hittorf**. 

**Wilhelm Röntgen**, German physicist, discovered *X-rays*, by means of using a *Crookes tube*. 

**Joseph John Thomson** discovered the electron while investigating the flux of cathode rays. 

**Robert Andrews Millikan**, American physicist, in 1906 while performing his *"oil drop"* experiment, determined the charge of the electron.

Nowadays, the understanding and control of the electrical phenomenon has made possible the implementation of electricity in all types of industrial applications known to civillization; even in the medical field (physiotherapy, electrotherapy, etc.)
